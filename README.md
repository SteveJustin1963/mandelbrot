# mandelbrot

Certainly! I'll rewrite the Mandelbrot set program in MINT, combining elements from the Forth and BASIC versions you've provided. This program will output ASCII characters to a serial terminal, creating a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set.



This MINT program generates a Mandelbrot set and outputs it as ASCII characters to a serial terminal. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We define constants for the x and y ranges, step size, and loop limit.
2. Variables `a`, `b`, and `i` are initialized.
3. Helper functions `S` (scale) and `M` (multiply and add) are defined to handle scaling operations.
4. The `I` function performs one iteration of the Mandelbrot algorithm.
5. The main `M` function contains nested loops for x and y coordinates:
   - It resets `a`, `b`, and `i` for each point.
   - It iterates using the `I` function until the magnitude exceeds the limit or the iteration count reaches 10.
   - It prints an ASCII character based on the iteration count.
6. Finally, we call the `M` function to run the program.

To use this program:

1. Load it into your MINT environment.
2. Run it by simply calling `M`.

The program will output an ASCII representation of the Mandelbrot set to your serial terminal. The characters will range from ASCII 48 ('0') to 58 (':'), with '0' representing points inside the set and higher ASCII values representing how quickly points escape.

Note that this program uses scaled integer arithmetic to approximate floating-point calculations, which may result in some loss of precision compared to floating-point implementations. However, it should still produce a recognizable Mandelbrot set visualization.
