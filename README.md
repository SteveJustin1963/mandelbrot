# mandelbrot



1. `CA` and `CB` define constants for scaling.
2. `A` and `B` are used for the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
3. `ITERATE` performs one iteration of the Mandelbrot formula.
4. `MANDELBROT` is the main function that loops through the grid and applies the iterations.
5. floating-point arithmetic (`0.0458 *`, `4.0 f>`, etc.), convert to fixed-point arithmetic as integers, scaling them as needed.

adjust  code, scale all numbers by a power of 10 (or 2) and then perform integer arithmetic. For example, instead of `0.0458 *`, multiply by `458` and then divide by `10000` later, using 16-bit integers all along.

simplified modified version with 16-bit integers and fixed-point arithmetic (assuming that the Forth-83 implementation supports 16-bit integer operations): using scaled integers for `A` and `B` (by a factor of 1000) and the constants `CA` and `CB` (by a factor of 10000). All calculations are done using 16-bit integers, adjust the scale factors as needed.
