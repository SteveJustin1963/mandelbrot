pseudocode representation 

PRINT_NEWLINE symbolizes moving to a new line in the output (equivalent to CR in Forth).
CALL ITERATE() symbolizes invoking the ITERATE routine, which performs one iteration of the Mandelbrot algorithm.
REPEAT ... UNTIL represents the loop that continues until the specified condition is met (equivalent to BEGIN ... UNTIL in Forth).
PRINT ASCII CHARACTER (48 + I) prints an ASCII character based on the value of the counter I (equivalent to 48 + EMIT in Forth).
This should give you a high-level overview of what the Forth code is doing.
